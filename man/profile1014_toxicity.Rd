\description{
This dataset contains simulated toxicity data and quality of life (QoL) scores
from the PROFILE 1014 randomized clinical trial (crizotinib versus chemotherapy
in ALK+ non–small cell lung cancer). It includes both any‑grade (G1–4) and
severe (G3–4) adverse events. Patient‑reported QoL scores are stored in the
\code{qol} column. The dataset provides the number of patients per trial arm.
Please refer to the accompanying documentation or vignette for details on how
QoL scores are defined and interpreted.
