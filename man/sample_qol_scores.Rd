\title{Sample Quality of Life (QoL) Scores from a Multinomial Distribution}
\usage{
sample_qol_scores(prob_vector, n_samples)
}
\arguments{
\item{prob_vector}{A numeric vector containing exactly 5 probabilities, which
**must sum to 1**. Each element corresponds to the probability of the QoL
scores `[-2, -1, 0, +1, +2]`, respectively.}

\item{n_samples}{An integer specifying the total number of samples to generate
(i.e., the length of the output vector).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length `n_samples` containing the sampled QoL
  scores. Each element in the vector will be one of the values from
  `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`.
}
\description{
This function generates a vector of random Quality of Life (QoL) scores by
sampling from a discrete probability distribution. It simulates outcomes
where each sample has a specific probability of falling into one of five
predefined QoL change categories.
}
\details{
This function is a robust wrapper around the base R `sample()` function. It's
specifically configured for sampling with replacement from the discrete set
of scores `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`. It includes validation to ensure the input
probability vector is correctly formatted. This is useful for simulating
patient cohorts in health economic models or clinical trial simulations.

\examples{
# --- 1. Define a probability vector ---
# This vector represents a "No Difference / Marginal Benefit" scenario.
# P(-2)=0.1, P(-1)=0.15, P(0)=0.5, P(+1)=0.15, P(+2)=0.1
my_probs <- c(0.1, 0.15, 0.5, 0.15, 0.1)

# --- 2. Set the number of samples ---
# For example, simulate a cohort of 1000 patients.
num_patients <- 1000

# --- 3. Generate the sampled scores ---
qol_draws <- sample_qol_scores(prob_vector = my_probs, n_samples = num_patients)

# --- 4. View the results ---
# Look at the first few sampled scores
head(qol_draws)

# Check the distribution of the generated samples.
# It should approximate the input probabilities.
table(qol_draws) / num_patients
