\description{
This dataset contains simulated toxicity data and quality of life (QoL) scores
from the PALOMA‑2 randomized clinical trial (palbociclib plus letrozole in
hormone receptor–positive, HER2–negative advanced breast cancer). It includes
both any‑grade (G1–4) and severe (G3–4) adverse events. Patient‑reported QoL
scores are stored in the \code{qol} column. The dataset provides the number of
patients per trial arm. Please refer to the accompanying documentation or
vignette for details on how QoL scores are defined and interpreted.
