\description{
This dataset contains simulated toxicity data from the LUX‑Lung 8 randomized
clinical trial (RCT), including both any‑grade (G1–4) and severe (G3–4)
adverse events. It also includes patient‑reported quality of life (QoL) scores
stored in the \code{qol} column. The dataset provides the number of patients
per trial arm. Please refer to the accompanying documentation or vignette for
details on how QoL scores are defined and interpreted.
