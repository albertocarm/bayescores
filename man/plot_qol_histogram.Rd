\title{Plot an Elegant Histogram of QoL Outcomes}
\usage{
plot_qol_histogram(qol_scores_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{qol_scores_vector}{A numeric vector of sampled QoL scores, where each
element is one of `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`. This is typically the output from
`sample_qol_scores()`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object representing the customized histogram. This object
  can be printed to display the plot or be further modified.
}
\description{
This function takes a numeric vector of sampled Quality of Life (QoL) scores
and creates an elegant bar plot that functions as a histogram. It visualizes
the distribution of outcomes, showing the probability of each category on the
y-axis and using descriptive labels on the x-axis.
}
\details{
The function first calculates the proportion (probability) of each unique score
`[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`. It then maps these numeric scores to meaningful labels
(e.g., "Significant Deterioration") and uses a diverging color palette to
intuitively represent negative, neutral, and positive outcomes. The bars are
directly labeled with their corresponding probabilities.
}
\examples{
# --- 1. First, generate a vector of sampled scores ---
# prob_vector <- c(0.05, 0.20, 0.50, 0.20, 0.05)
# scores <- sample_qol_scores(prob_vector, n_samples = 2000)

# --- 2. Now, plot the results with the new function ---
# final_plot <- plot_qol_histogram(scores)

# --- 3. Display the plot ---
# print(final_plot)
