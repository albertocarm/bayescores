Title: Comprehensive Quantification of Clinical Benefit in Randomized 
    Controlled Trials using Bayesian AFT Cure Models and BayeScores

Description: Provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing randomized 
    controlled trials (RCTs). This package introduces the Bayesian Clinical 
    Benefit Scores (BayeScores), a novel metric to quantify the magnitude 
    of clinical benefit by accounting for both survival prolongation and 
    cure rates. It overcomes limitations of existing frameworks (like ESMO-MCBS 
    or ASCO-VF) by providing more accurate and transparent information to 
    facilitate informed clinical decision-making. The package includes 
    functions to simulate data, fit Bayesian Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) 
    mixture cure models, and visualize results.
